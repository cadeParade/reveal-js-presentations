					<h1>THE WHITEBOARD INTERVIEW</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is whiteboard interviewing?</h2>
					<p>
						During an interview, you will be asked to solve a programming problem and code the solution on a whiteboard.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What are interviewers looking for?</h2>
					<br>
					<p>
						They are asking:
					</p>
						<ul style="font-size:0.8em;">
							<li>can you code?</li>
							<li>can think through problems logically?</li>
							<li>can you <strong>communicate</strong> clearly?</li>
							<li>can you <strong>collaborate</strong> well?</li>
							<li>can you remain calm and reasonable?</li>
							<li>will you give up?</li>
						</ul>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<p style="font-size:0.7em;">
							Occasionally they are looking for whether you know a particular algorithm.  <span class="fragment"> : (</span>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							As a junior developer, you can't know everything. Therefore, it is SO important that you're able to communicate your ideas and collaboratewell. They won't expect you to know everything but they want to know that you can think.
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Strategies</h2>
					<h3>Preparing to answer (before you start any writing)</h3>
					<p>
						<ul style="font-size:0.8em;">
							<li>Don't start coding right away</li>
							<li>Think about the question.</li>
							<li>Ask clarifying questions to make sure you've got the question straight in your head.</li>
							<li>TALK!! NEVER stop talking!</li>
							<li>If you can, outline the steps verbally before writing anything.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Strategies</h2>
					<h3>Once you start writing</h3>
					<p>
					<ul style="font-size: 0.8em">
						<li>Try pseudocode at first.</li>
						<li>Try to write neatly :)</li>
						<li>Try to leave lots of space between your lines.</li>

					</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Strategies</h2>
					<h3>Uh oh I messed up</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 0.8em">
						You <strong>WILL</strong> make a mistake.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 0.8em">
						When discovered (either by yourself or the interviewer), handle it gracefully.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 0.8em">
						Mistakes <strong>ARE NOT</strong> the end of an interview -- but handling criticism poorly or not accepting them might be.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p style="font-size: 0.8em">
						A <strong>working solution</strong> is better than no solution. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p style="font-size: 0.8em">
						If you know there is a more efficient way, but aren't sure how to do it on the fly, don't panic. Write a solution that works. <strong>Communicate</strong> with the interviewer that you <strong>know there's a better way</strong>, but you'll <strong>start</strong> with the <strong>simplest</strong> way.
					</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					If you think it's too easy and there must be a trick, don't worry too much, a common pattern is to start easy and once that is done, test limits of knowledge
				</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Strategies</h2>
					<h3>Everything is terrible I can't do anything omg I can't even</h3>
					<ul style="font-size: 0.7em">
						<li>
							Think about <strong>practice problems</strong> you've completed. Are there any that have a <strong>similar pattern</strong> or can complete a piece of your problem?</li>
						<li>Think about <strong>data structures</strong> -- what are advantages of some vs others. Can these advantages fit your problem?</li>
						<li>Think about how to <strong>break down the problem</strong>. What <strong>tiny step</strong> can you take to get you closer to the solution. Talk about each step you think about out loud, the interviewer should give you some feedback if you seem stuck</li>
						<li>If you really can't think of a way to start, you can <strong>ask for a hint</strong> or a bit of guidance.</li>
						<li><strong>Don't give up.</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Additional notes from discussions</h2>
					<ul style="font-size:0.8em">
						<li>Practice writing on a whiteboard before interviews (a lot!) because writing on a whiteboard is way different than typing or even writing on paper (Thanks, Marlene!)</li>
						<li>As the interviewer is explaining the problem, take down notes about the problem (Thanks, Katie!)</li>
						<li>Once you think you have a working version of your algorithm, verbally walk through how the algorithm would act on your test cases. This will help catch any errors or edge cases in your program. (Thanks, volunteers!)</li>
					</ul>
